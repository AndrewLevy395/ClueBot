Introducing ClueBot!

ClueBot is a bot that will help you win games of Clue. No longer will you need 
to keep track of suspects, weapons, and rooms on a tiny piece of paper. Cluebot
 will do it for you! All you need to do is tell ClueBot what's happening and then
 sit back and let ClueBot do the work.
 
HOW TO USE:

ClueBot starts off the game by asking the user the number of players. Simply input 
the number of players (including yourself) and then input the names of each player.
ClueBot also needs to know what cards you have in your hand so it will ask you to
input those as well. Now you are all set and ready to begin the game. 

After each event in the game, you should let ClueBot know what is happening so that
it can calculate which suspect is guilty, which weapon they used, and in which room
the murder took place. ClueBot will ask you to update it with each in-game event.
These events include a reveal, a witness, and a pass. A reveal is when an opposing 
player reveals a card to you after you make a suggestion. A witness is when an 
opposing player reveals a card to another opposing player after they make a suggestion.
A pass is when an opposing player has no cards and must pass during a suggestion.
Using these events as clues, ClueBot will be able to run its algorithm to determine
whodunit. 

When prompted by ClueBot for in-game events, you also have other options to prompt
ClueBot with. ClueBot can display an opposing players information, undo the previous 
event, display all remaining cards with unknown alibi (not in any player's hand), and 
show all available options with "help".

Using these events and commands, ClueBot should be able to help you to uncover the truth
of the murder and win many matches of the great board game of Clue. Enjoy!
